## Natural Language Processing - Large Language Model

This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects and notebooks that demonstrate how to use powerful pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The primary goal is to provide a practical, hands-on guide for leveraging state-of-the-art models from the open-source community to perform complex language tasks efficiently and effectively. Each project is designed to be an end-to-end guide, from understanding the core concepts of the NLP task to the final implementation using a pre-trained model.

### Project Areas Covered
Each folder in this repository is dedicated to a specific NLP topic. Within each project, you will find detailed explanations of the foundational theories and step-by-step code implementations using pre-trained models.

- **Text Generation:** Projects in this area focus on building models that can create new, coherent, and contextually relevant text. We'll explore powerful generative models like GPT-4o (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and Llama (Meta).
- **Machine Translation:** This section covers models specialized in translating text between different languages. We'll implement solutions using models like T5 (Google), which treats translation as a text-generation task, and NLLB (Meta), a large-scale model designed for high-accuracy translation across numerous languages.
- **Text Summarization:** Learn how to condense long documents into shorter, more concise summaries. This includes using models like BART (Meta), which is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, and Pegasus (Google), which excels at creating abstractive summaries.
- **Question Answering (QA):** Develop models that can read a given text and either extract or generate an answer to a question. We will use models like BERT (Google) for its deep contextual understanding and RoBERTa (Meta), a more robustly trained version of BERT.
- **Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis:** Build models to categorize text into predefined classes or determine the emotional tone. We will use fine-tuned versions of BERT and RoBERTa, as well as DistilBERT, a smaller, faster model ideal for real-time applications.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Create systems that can identify and classify key entities in text, such as names, locations, and organizations. We will leverage the deep contextual understanding of BERT and RoBERTa for this task.
- **Information Retrieval and Search:** Implement components for finding relevant documents from a large corpus of text. This section will demonstrate the use of models like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) and Sentence-BERT to create semantically meaningful embeddings for efficient searches.
- **Paraphrase Detection and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS):** Learn to build models that can determine when two different sentences have the same meaning. We will focus on models like Sentence-BERT, which is specifically designed for this task.
- **Speech Recognition:** Projects in this area focus on converting spoken language into text. We'll use models like Whisper (OpenAI), a versatile model pre-trained on a massive amount of audio data, and Wav2Vec 2.0 (Meta), which learns speech representations directly from raw audio.

## Optimization Techniques for LLMs
To ensure that these models are practical and efficient, this repository also includes notebooks on optimization techniques.

- **Quantization**: Reduces model size and speeds up calculations by using lower-precision numbers.
- **Pruning**: Removes unnecessary connections and weights from the network to create a smaller, faster model.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Trains a small "student" model to mimic the behavior of a larger "teacher" model, achieving similar performance with a smaller footprint.
- **Low-Rank Factorization**: Approximates large weight matrices with a product of smaller matrices, drastically reducing the number of parameters.
